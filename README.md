## Introduction to scalable systems

Examples of operational dimensions are:

- The number of simultaneous user or external (e.g., sensor) requests a system can process
- The amount of data a system can effectively process and manage
- The value that can be derived from the data a system stores through predictive analytics
- The ability to maintain a stable, consistent response time as the request load grows

In software systems, we can expand and contract our processing capacity in a matter of seconds to meet instantaneous load.
